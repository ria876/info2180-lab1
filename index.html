 <h2>Brianna Roper </h2>
 <p>I am Brianna Roper, a Computer Science Major at the University of the West Indies. When I am not occupied my school or work, 
I love to go on excursions with my peers. This may be surfing in Bull Bay or traveling cross-country to Negril. I am particularly fond of the sea, 
as it is a place where earth settles the mind no matter how turbulent.  </p>
<p>The web is an integral part of our daily lives applicable to every field.
 It would be invaluable to learn front end development as it is ripe with opportunity and ever evolving. 
 This course is an opportunity to enter the vast niche.</p>
